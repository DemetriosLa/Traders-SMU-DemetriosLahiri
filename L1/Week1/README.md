*Level 1 (Junior)

## 1. Background in Quantitative Finance

Though I regrettably have not had any jobs or internships in the finance field as of yet, I have had extensive trading experience as I have invested in stocks since I was 11. In this trading experience, I have inadvertently learned a few key quantitative finance concepts such as the importance of hedging, judging a market's volatility, and unwittingly applying basic statistical models to inform when to sell or buy a stock based on the average price this stock achieved and its most probable path of growth. When I joined SMU and the quantitative finance club and the field of quantitative finance in general, I saw that, if I had learned some of these concepts earlier, I would have been able to make much more informed decisions on when to buy and sell instead of relying on mere "blind reckoning", showing me the merits of this fascinating field.

## 2. Career Goals

In the long term, I hope to gain a position as a risk quant in a firm such as Jump trading as I would like to be involved in a firm that focuses on high frequency trading, as this is a fascinating concept to me. However I understand that, in the short term, this is probably an unrealistic goal due to the competition in this firm, so I shall attempt to better understand the concepts of hedging thus allowing me next year to find a less competitive firm, such as the 1989 Millennium Management hedge fund, allowing me to build experience in the quantitative finance field. Ultimately I hope to find a niche in the quantitative finance field which I can excel in, allowing me to become the expert in this field, and ultimately allowing me to progress to a higher position in a firm such as Jump trading.

## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

I hope to be able to gain an understanding of the quantitative finance field and how it pertains to high frequency trading, better understand the intricacies present in coding with python and C++, exactly how to use it to issue trades, and I hope to gain a better understanding of how to develop and pitch my statistical analysis of a stock. I also hope to learn, through the different classes of models that can be used to build the strategies for stock trading, how to better gauge the range of a stock, so that I may buy or sell my stocks more efficiently in the future. Ultimately, I hope eventually to meld the concepts I learn with my other interests, such as engineering, so that I will be able to find a sector in the quantitative finance field that I can excel at, becoming an expert in this field.

## 4. Current Technical Skills

I have a basic understanding of python coding, so I would rate myself as a beginner. I have done some basic work in financial modeling as it pertains to the stock exchange, but have not yet fully gained the programming skills to make a complex financial model. I have also had some experience in coding some basic parallel framework machine learning systems, as I have participated in a program that discussed how to build some basic parallel systems, as well as the merits of these systems.

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals



In this program, I hope to be able to gain an understanding of how to code and use python in high frequency trading, as well as to understand the "greeks" of finance and how I can use them in statistical modeling. I also hope to better understand and utilize models such as the Black-Scholes Model and how it pertains to financial probability. I hope to do this by studying the books, resources, and projects that will be offered by this program, as well as doing further personal research on at least one finance term and model system each week. I shall measure my progress by looking at my performance on the quizzes offered by this program, and how well I am able to retain the information I have learned over the week. My definition of success would be to master python coding, and to gain an understanding of statistical modeling.
