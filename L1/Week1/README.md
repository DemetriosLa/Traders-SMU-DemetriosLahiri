## 3. What I Hope to Learn from This Program

I hope to gain a deeper understanding of stastical modeling and the general field of quantitative finance, as well as to better understand the math, programing skills neccesary for success in this field. I also hope to learn, through the different classes of models that can be used to build the strategies for stock trading, how to better gauge the range of a stock, so that I may buy or sell my stocks more efficently in the future.

## 4. Current Technical Skills

I have a basic understanding of python coding, so I would rate myself as a beginner. I have done some basic work in financial modeling as it pertains to the stock exchange, but have not yet fully gained the programming skills to make a complex financial model. I have also had some experience in coding some basic parallel framework machine learning systems, as I have participated in a program that discussed how to build some basic parallel systems, as well as the merits of these systems.

## 5. Development Plan & Program Goals

In this program, I hope to be able to gain a understanding of how to code in python, understand how to use python coding in high frequency trading, and learn to understand the "greeks" of finance and how I can use them in stastical modeling. I also hope to better understand and utilze models such as the Black-Scholes Model and how it pertains to financial probabilty. I hope to do this by studying the books, resoruces, and projects that will be offered by this program, as well as doing further personal research on at least one finace term and model system each week. I shall measure my progress by looking at my performance on the quizzes offered by this program, and how well I am able to retain the information I have learned over the week.

*I understand that this document will be used to track my progress throughout the program and may be referenced during career counseling sessions. I commit to working toward these goals during the Traders@SMU Alpha Program.*
